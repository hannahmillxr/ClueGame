NUM_COLUMNS was changed to 30, as our gam board is wider than the example game board.

The testRoomLabels() function was changed to reflect our room titles and symbols,
for example we test to make sure an Armory cell has the initial 'A', or the 
Dojo has the initial 'D', etc. 

The FourDoorDirections function was changed to reflect the doors in our game board,
the door into the bedrooms at cell (8,6) opens left, the cell at (6,3) opens up 
into the kitchen, the cell at (9,18) opens right into the court yard, and the cell
at (19, 8) opens down into the dojo.

The number of doorways was changed to reflect that we have 12 doors in our board game.

Finally, test rooms was altered to correspond to the rooms in our game, and the locations
of their secret passages, center, and label.
